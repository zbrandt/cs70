\begin{homeworkProblem}{Touring Hypercube}

    An the lecture, you have seen that if $G$ is a hypercube of dimension $n$, then
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The vertices of $G$ are the binary strings of length $n$.
        \item $u$ and $v$ are connected by an edge if they differ in exactly one bit location.
    \end{itemize}
    
    A \emph{Hamiltonian tour} of a graph (with $n \geq 2$ vertices) is a tour that visits every vertex exactly once.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[A)] Prove that a hypercube has an Eulerian tour if and only if $n$ is even.
        \item[B)] Prove that every hypercube has a Hamiltonian tour. 
    \end{itemize}
