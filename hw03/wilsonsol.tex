\begin{homeworkProblem}{Wilson's Theorem}

    Wilson's Theorem states the following is true if and only if $p$ is prime:
    \[(p - 1)! \equiv -1 \pmod{p}.\]
    Prove both directions (it holds if AND only if $p$ is prime).

    Hint for the if direction: Consider rearranging the terms in $(p - 1)! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot \cdots \cdot (p - 1)$ to pair up terms with their inverses, when possible. What terms are left unpaired?

    Hint for the only if direction: If $p$ is composite, then it has some prime factor $q$.  What can we say about $(p-1)! \pmod{q}$?
