\begin{homeworkProblem}{How Many Solutions?}
    Consider the equation $ax \equiv b \pmod p$ for prime $p$. In the below three parts, when we discuss solutions, we mean a solution $x$ in the range $\{0, 1, \dots p-1\}$. In addition, include justification for your answers to all the subparts of this problem.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[A)] For how many pairs $(a,b)$ does the equation have a unique solution?
        \item[B)] For how many pairs $(a,b)$ does the equation have no solution?
        \item[C)] For how many pairs $(a,b)$ does the equation have $p$ solutions?
    \end{itemize}

    Now, consider the equation $ax \equiv b \pmod{pq}$ for distinct primes $p,q$. In the below three parts, when we discuss solutions, we mean a solution $x$ in the range $\{0, 1, \dots pq-1\}$.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[D)] If $\gcd(a, pq) = p$, show that there exists a solution if and only if $b = 0 \pmod p$. 
        \item[E)] If $\gcd(a, pq) = p$ and there is a solution $x$, show that there are exactly $p$ solutions. (Hint: consider how you can generate another solution $x + \_\_\_$)
        \item[F)] For how many pairs $(a,b)$ are there exactly $p$ solutions? 
    \end{itemize}
