\begin{homeworkProblem}{Short Tree Proofs}

    Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected graph with $|V| \geq 1$.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[A)] Prove that every connected component in an acyclic graph is a tree.
        \item[B)] Suppose $G$ has $k$ connected components. Prove that if $G$ is acyclic, then $|E|=|V|-k$.
        \item[C)] Prove that a graph with $|V|$ edges contains a cycle. 
    \end{itemize}
