\begin{homeworkProblem}{Academic Integrity}
    
    I pledge to uphold the universityâ€™s honor code: to act with honesty, 
    integrity, and respect for others, including their work. By signing, I 
    ensure that all written homework I submit will be in my own words, that 
    I will acknowledge any collaboration or help received, and that I will 
    neither give nor receive help on any examinations.
