\begin{homeworkProblem}{Use of Ed}
    Ed is incredibly useful for Q\&A in such a large-scale class. We will 
    use Ed for all important announcements. You should check it frequently. 
    We also highly encourage you to use Ed to ask questions and answer 
    questions from your fellow students.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[(a)] Read the Ed Etiquette section of the course policies and 
        explain what is wrong with the following hypothetical student 
        question: ``Can someone explain the proof of Theorem XYZ to me?" 
        (Assume Theorem XYZ is a complicated concept.)
        \item[(b)] When are the weekly posts released? Are they required 
        reading?
        \item[(c)] If you have a question or concern not directly related 
        to the course content, where should you direct it? 
    \end{itemize}

    \solution

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[(a)] Explaining the proof might give away the answer. 
        Instead, you should explain in a way so other students can 
        understand the problem, without spoiling the answer to them. 
        \item[(b)] The weekly posts are released on Mondays and are 
        required reading.
        \item[(c)] Questions or concerns not regarding course content but 
        rather policy should be directed to \href{mailto:sp25@eecs70.org}
        {sp25@eecs70.org}.
    \end{itemize}
